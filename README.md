# Web Putty 
##for Web Devs

by [mduca](http://michael.mandu.ca)

This application is intended to scratch an itch. A weird itch at that.


### Back Story

I llllllove keyboard shortcuts. It's some weird obbsession at times. Friends are entertained,
other developers are amused, and I'm more productive. 

### Origin

This project gives me the ability to use alreaady memorized muscle macros with my favorite
ssh terminal putty. Launching putty applications takes several clicks. Even if predefined
profiles are already in use. I want the ability to launch a local web app that stores all
my sessions anyway I want.


### Todo

generate pages controller  
build putty form
